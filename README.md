# Titanic-
### A complete guide project on how to apply machine learning on a very common and well known dataset "Titanic"
```
The dataset is taken from kaggle. Kaggle offers 2 dataset for this purpose
1 : Training Data
2: Testing Data
Our goal is to predict the target variable i.e Survival rate.
```

### Steps for making this project are as follows:
```
1 : Analysis of the data , which include following parameters:
 a : Checking missing or null values
 b : Checking for duplicate values
 c : handling the missing values
2 : Analysis of featues:
 a: Numeric
 b: Categorical
 c: Label encoding or encoding the categorical features
3 : Correlation and Visualization
4 : Spliting our given training data into train and test data for checking the accuracy
5 : Featue Engineering
6 : Modeling using simple Logistic regression algorithm.
```
# Libraries used:
```
Scikit Learn
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
```

## With the help of simple logistic regression, the accuracy my model is capable to reach is **0.81005**
